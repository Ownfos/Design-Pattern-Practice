# Design-Pattern-Practice
The purpose of this project is as following:
1. Practice implementing each design pattern with simple example
2. Implement each example again in naive way (only simple inheritance)
3. Compare pros and cons of two counterparts.
4. Analyze the situation where we might want to apply each design patter
<br>
Detailed description and explanation for each example can be found in Program.cs

## Structure of source files
- root folder
  - Program.cs : all test codes are here
  - [Design patter name] folders
    - "Naive" folder : contains implementation using simple inheritance
    - "Better" folder : contains implementation using a design pattern

## Comments on Program.cs
The main function calls one test function for each design patter example.<br>
Each test function will first use Naive version, then do the same thing with Better version.<br>
